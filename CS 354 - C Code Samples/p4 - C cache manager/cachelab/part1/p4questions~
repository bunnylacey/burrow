For ALL cache simulations, use a capacity of 16384 bytes, and set associativity of 1, for both 
the I-cache and the D-cache.

Sample command line:
/p/course/cs354-common/public/cache/pin -injection child -t /p/course/cs354-common/public/cache/source/tools/Memory/obj-ia32/allcache.so -is 16384 -ia 1 -ib 64 -ds 16384 -da 1 -db <block-size> -- yourexe

Replace "yourexe" with the name of your executable.

4. (to be answered without running pin)
For this question, assume that the 100,000 elements long integer array that you allocated starts at address 0x50000000 in memory,
the size of an integer is 4 bytes  and the D-cache is initially empty. 
As you READ the integers in the array one-by-one, starting at index 0, 
how many D-cache misses will you see for reading the first 40 integers when the cache block size is:

a) 4 bytes:
	40 Misses
b) 32 bytes:
	5 Misses
c) 64 bytes:
	3 Misses
5. Based on simulations you ran for questions 1, 2 and 3, which block size is best for the D-cache?  
Why? In what way does the block size affect the hit ratio for this program?

	Best block size is 64 bytes, because the miss ratio is lowest.

Comparison of cache2Drows and cache2Dcols

8. (to be answered without running pin) 
For this question, assume that the 2-D integer array you allocated starts at address 0x40000000 in memory,
the size of an integer is 4 bytes, D-cache block size is 64 bytes and the D-cache is initially empty.
As you READ the integers in the 2-D array one-by-one, starting with element array[0,0],
how many D-cache misses will you see for reading the first 10 integers in case of:

a) cache2Drows:
	1 miss
b) cache2Dcols:
	10 miss
9. Compare the performance (hit ratios) of the D-cache for the 2 programs based on simulations of questions 6 and 7.
Explain any difference/ lack of difference that you observe. Your answer should be in the form of "There is a difference/no difference BECAUSE ____".
	There is a difference because, each individual call in cache2Dcols must load an entire cache line to access that cell.  Whereas cache2Drows takes advantage of the spatial locality of the entire cache line when accessing the next called cell.
