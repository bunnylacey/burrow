Question - demo.c shows us that if a program is stuck in an infinite loop, it cannot go forward. Our program for a simple alarm (intdate.c) also has an infinite while loop. Yet, we see the print statements like below when we execute it -

-----------------------------------------
./intdate
Date will be printed every 3 seconds
Enter ^C to end the program:
current time is Thu Dec  1 20:46:20 2016
current time is Thu Dec  1 20:46:23 2016
current time is Thu Dec  1 20:46:26 2016
^C
----------------------------------------

Q: How does the main function of intdate.c come out of the infinite while loop to print these statement?
When the alarm times out it sets the signal SIGALRM and will be put in a pending state.  The kernel will force the process to react to the pending signal by processing a default action or a function registered to handle the signal.
